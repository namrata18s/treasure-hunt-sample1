# Python Treasure Hunt

This is a tutorial on building a MineSweeper-like game called Sonar Treasure Hunt. Rather than playing it in a GUI with a point and click interface, we'll be doing it in the console.

Programming text-based games is a relatively common part of coding interviews. It tests a number of basic coding skills and the console is the great equalizer.

We'll be using a slide-based deck in the workshop, but keep this window open as it will correlate with the slides and give you more details than the slides.
